Changes to ozone levels in the atmosphere accounted for almost ⅓ of the warming seen in ocean waters bordering Antarctica in the second half of the 20th century. This rapid and severe warming affects the Southern Ocean’s role in soaking up excess heat as the planet warms.

The majority of this warming was the result of ozone increases in the lower atmosphere. Dr Michaela Hegglin, an Associate Professor in atmospheric chemistry, explains that "ozone close to Earth's surface is harmful to people and the environment, but this study reveals it also has a big impact on the ocean's ability to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere."

In the upper atmosphere, ozone is formed by the interaction between oxygen molecules and the sun’s UV rays. It is created, in the lower atmosphere, due to chemical reactions between pollutants like vehicle exhaust fumes and other emissions. It's a component of smog.

An international team of scientists, led by the University of California Riverside, conducted new research where models were used to simulate changes in ozone levels in the upper and lower atmosphere between 1955 and 2000. It was found that the increased ozone in the lower atmosphere caused 60% of the overall ozone-induced warming in the Southern Ocean during that period -- a lot more than was expected previously. 

The ozone layer is vital since it filters harmful UV radiation from reaching Earth's surface. Yet, “our research has shown that ozone increases in the lower atmosphere due to air pollution, which occurs primarily in the Northern Hemisphere and 'leaks' into the Southern Hemisphere, is a serious problem as well”, says Dr Hegglin.

However, "there is hope to find solutions, and the success of the Montreal Protocol at cutting CFC use shows that international action is possible to prevent damage to the planet."
