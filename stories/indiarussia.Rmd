Western sanctions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine pushed Russian crude into record low prices against other grades. India, the third-largest oil importer, called for an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine but has not explicitly condemned Russia's actions. Indian refiners took this opportunity to snap up Russian crude at a discounted price.

[<span style="color:green">According to Bloomberg</span>](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-05-04/india-wants-russia-to-discount-its-oil-to-less-than-70-a-barrel), between state and private refiners, India has bought more than 40 million barrels of Russian crude since February 24, 2022. That's 20% more than Russia-to-India flows for all of 2021. India is trying to get deeper discounts and seeking cargoes at less than $70 a barrel to compensate for the risks of buying from Russia amidst western sanctions. Global benchmark Brent is currently trading near $105 a barrel. India's top refiners are negotiating a 6 month deal to import [<span style="color:green">around half a million barrels a day</span> ](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-05-02/russia-india-in-negotiations-on-crude-oil-deal-video) from Russia starting in June. 

India's oil minister defended the increased oil imports from Russia stating that the purchases are a fraction of the overall annual need and the government does not intervene in the refiners' import deals.
