[Well, that's not good](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/keystone-pipeline-1.6680590). 

TC Energy has confirmed that it is dealing with a 14,000 barrel (yes, 14,000 barrel) leak on the Keystone pipeline, with oil having entered a creek in Kansas. 

This is at least the third major spill on the Keystone line, with previous incidents in 2017 and 2019.

This is also one of the largest oil spills from a pipeline in recent US history. In 2013, a Tesoro line spilled over 20,000 barrels and, in another incident well-known to oil sands watchers, an Enbridge pipeline also spilled more than 20,000 barrels in Michigan in 2010. 

Hoping that the impact is limited.
