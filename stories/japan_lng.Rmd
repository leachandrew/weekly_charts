Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida visited Canada this week as part of a five-country tour as Japan takes over the presidency of the G7. One of the topics of interest: the possibility of increased liquid natural gas exports from Canada. 

Ahead of Prime Minister Kishida's arrival, Alberta Premier Danielle Smith sent [a letter to Prime Minister Trudeau](https://calgarysun.com/opinion/columnists/bell-smith-writes-trudeau-urges-yes-to-natural-gas-for-japan) urging him to agree to export more energy to Japan. The country's desire for Canadian LNG is primarily driven by the world's ["energy crisis"](https://nationalpost.com/news/politics/trudeau-energy-japan-canada-lng) and a desire to stop importing from Russia, previously about 10% of the Japanese natural gas supply. Fears of an energy shortage, like that faced in Europe last year, have led the G7 to exempt Japan from the [cap on Russian oil prices](https://calgaryherald.com/business/smith-calls-on-trudeau-to-bolster-energy-security-with-japan-during-kishidas-visit).

Throughout the meetings, Trudeau made no commitments regarding LNG exports and focused his statements and discussions on decarbonization and critical minerals. He announced that the government will lead a trade mission to Japan to discuss critical minerals and other opportunities this fall. A lack of commitment to LNG exports is somewhat unsurprising. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited Canada in late August, stressing his country's desire to partner with Canada for gas. The Trudeau government expressed little interest stating that there has ["never been a strong business case"](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-germany-qatar-gas) for these kinds of exports. Trudeau focused on a hydrogen agreement instead. Germany has since gone elsewhere for LNG, signing a [fifteen-year agreement with Qatar](https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/canada-germany-qatar-gas).
