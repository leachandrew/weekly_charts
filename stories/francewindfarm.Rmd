France has completed construction of their first commercial offshore wind farm, and it is now in full operation. The project, which has been in the works since 2012, cost roughly 2 billion Euros. Consisting of 80 turbines, the project has a capacity of 480 MW, and should generate enough energy to power 400,000 homes. Interestingly, the project was completed in partnership with Enbridge, Alberta's energy infrastructure giant.

Enbridge is best known for oil and gas projects, but like other companies in the space, Enbridge has an increasing stake in renewable power. Enbridge has a 25.5% stake in the project, and has also partnered with the Government of France on three other projects in Fecamp, Calvados, and Provence Grand Large. Given the energy crisis that Europe is facing, the project will have a considerable impact.
