## Energy Week

#### Erica Beattie

June 6th-10th is officially [Energy Week in Alberta](https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/energy-week-declaration/resource/7efa34d4-e19c-4f3e-b9c1-2cb2efaaeed6). The government declared this week to recognize the importance of the energy sector to Alberta's past, present, and future. We in Alberta are blessed with an abundance of energy resources and the province's energy sector supports nearly a [quarter million jobs](https://thebusinesscouncil.ca/publication/the-importance-of-canadas-energy-sector/#:~:text=The%20energy%20sector%20here%20in,far%20surpasses%20the%20national%20average). So it seems only right that there be an entire week dedicated to energy in Alberta.
