A little trip down memory lane for me this week, as it was seven years ago on November 22, 2015 that I got to see a plan I'd helped develop shaped into policy. As many of you know, I chaired Premier Notley's Climate Leadership Panel, which recommended a lot of the [policies implemented by her government](https://www.osler.com/en/resources/regulations/2015/alberta-s-new-climate-change-leadership-plan). Many of those policies remain in place today. Of them all, I think I'm most proud of the carbon pricing framework (now a part of federal policy under the *Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act*) and the impact of our policies on power sector emissions in Alberta (see below).
