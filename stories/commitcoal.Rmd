## Commit to coal, says “reliable” source

Fix and modernize South Africa’s existing coal power plants as a cheap and easy way to achieve a reasonable price of electricity, says [Andrey Melnichenko](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/energy/coal/russian-billionaire-resigns-from-biggest-coal-company-after-eu-sanctions-/34824), a sanctioned Russian coal industry billionaire.

Currently, [South Africa uses coal](https://www.energy.gov.za/files/coal_frame.html#:~:text=South%20Africa%27s%20indigenous%20energy%20resource,needs%20are%20provided%20by%20coal.) to generate 80% of its electricity.

South Africa has experienced more than [200 days of power cuts this year](https://www.africanews.com/2022/12/29/sa-power-cuts-force-companies-to-scale-back//#:~:text=2022%20has%20been%20one%20of,power%20cuts%20are%20slowly%20resuming.), each lasting about six hours per day, contributing to a lack of economic growth and political stress.

The state power utility claims they require $4.2 billion USD over the next 5 years to be able to expand their power grid, with additional funding needed for clean energy capacity.

With the falling costs of renewables, it is my hope that a more [obvious solution](https://theconversation.com/south-africa-could-produce-a-lot-more-renewable-energy-heres-what-it-needs-185897) than [committing to coal](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63513278) will be adopted by South Africa’s decision makers.
