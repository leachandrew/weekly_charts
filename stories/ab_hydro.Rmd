## Albertan Hydroelectricity
#### [Marc Vermette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-vermette/)

When we think about renewable energy in the prairies, your mind likely gravitates towards wind and solar power generation.

But it didn’t always used to be this way. In the early 1950s, around 50% of Alberta’s capacity was hydroelectric, but that share has since decreased to about 3-5%.

This decrease is expected to continue, with predicted hydroelectric capacity accounting for only 2% of total by 2050.

This despite the fact that, according to a 2010 study, Alberta contains [42-53,000 GWh](http://www.history.alberta.ca/energyheritage/energy/hydro-power/hydroelectricity-in-alberta-today.aspx) of hydroelectric energy potential.

So why aren't we seeing more hydro development?

The answer lies within the high costs and logistical demands of hydroelectric power generation, according to the Minister of Affordability and Utilities.

On top of these costs, downstream water rights for other uses, like farming, further conflict with the future development of any hydro-related projects.
