This winter is going to see record power prices for Albertans not on fixed rates. In a graph published yesterday on Twitter, University of Calgary economist Blake Shaffer [explains in a great Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bcshaffer/status/1583302049701466114) that the futures market currently suggests prices over 24c/kWh for regulated rates.

It's going to be a very expensive winter no matter what, but Shaffer reminds Albertans than they can still save by fixing to a fixed-price contract.
