## Barriers to Geothermal

The [Biden administration hopes to cut the costs of geothermal energy](https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3634606-biden-administration-aims-to-make-geothermal-energy-widespread/) generation in the US by 90% by 2035.

“The United States has a vast, geothermal energy resource lying right beneath our feet, and this program will make it economical to bring that power to American households and businesses,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said.

Costs of geothermal generators are heavily weighted toward early startup expenses, rather than fuel to keep them running or regular maintenance expenses.

Part of the issue starts with the fact that a [well must first be drilled](https://esmap.org/sites/default/files/esmap-files/Flovenz%20Day%201%20-WB-2-phases-final.pdf), an expensive process, only after which resource analysis and research of the well is done with no 100% guarantee that the well will be viable for a geothermal generator.

The initial cost for the well and power plants currently sits at around $2500/kW in the US, and up to double this for smaller plants. However, the operating costs range from about 0.01 to 0.03, which is similar to that of natural gas.
