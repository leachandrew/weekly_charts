## The Giant Swiss Water Battery
#### Debosree Mukherjee

Nant de Drance, a “water battery” located in Switzerland began its operations in July and has [an energy storage capacity equivalent to 400,000 electric car batteries](https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/01/world/water-battery-switzerland-renewable-energy-climate-scn-hnk-spc-intl/index.html). It is a giant pumped storage hydroelectric facility and is expected to play a big role in Europe's transition to renewable energy. 

Wind and solar power create inconsistent power supply. Variable-speed pump turbine-powered water batteries such as Nant de Drance can stabilize the electricity grid. The plant has reversible turbines and can quickly go from storing to providing electricity.

The cost to develop this plant was $2 billion and it took 14 years to complete. 17 kilometers of subterranean tunnels were excavated through the Alps. It has six turbines that are stored 600 meters below ground in a giant cavern. Two existing water reservoirs were re-purposed for this project, and they now hold more water than 6,500 Olympic-sized swimming pools! The plant can store 20 million kWh of potential energy, enough to power 900,000 homes. 

Europe is hoping to become the first climate-neutral continent and aims for 45% of its total electricity supply to come from renewable sources by 2030.  High-capacity storage facilities like Nant de Drance are essential to meet this goal.
