## Spending on Clean Energy Matches Fossil Fuels
#### [Marc Vermette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-vermette/)

The world spent $1.1 trillion USD last year replacing fossil fuels - the same amount that was spent producing oil and gas.

Solar and wind power accounted for 45% of this spending, and electric vehicles for 43%.

The 2022 renewable spending was 31% greater than 2021, but still far from what is needed to reach net zero by 2050. 

A [study by BloombergNEF](https://about.bnef.com/blog/global-low-carbon-energy-technology-investment-surges-past-1-trillion-for-the-first-time/) shows that annual spending would have to triple from its present all-time high to be able to reach this goal.

As for a win we CAN claim, when we factor in the strengthening of clean energy supply chains, power grids, and financing projects, the global spending on the energy transition exceeds that of oil and gas production by nearly $500 billion.
