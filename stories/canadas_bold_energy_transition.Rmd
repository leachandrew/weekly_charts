Experts say upgrading Canada's entire energy infrastructure in a short period of time will be a technical challenge that will cost [upwards of hundreds of billions of dollars](https://financialpost.com/commodities/energy/renewables/canadas-road-to-net-zero-will-cost-2-trillion-as-much-as-a-years-gdp).

The federal government has laid out an ambitious roadmap, consisting of:

 * [carbon capture](https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage)
 * [hydrogen development](https://afdc.energy.gov/fuels/hydrogen_production.html)
 * rapid [electrification of transportation systems](https://www.pwc.com/ca/en/industries/power-utilities/publications/electrification-of-transportation.html)
 * accelerated sustainable energy roll-out, including:
   + wind power
   + solar power

This is to get Canada to its climate target of cutting emissions by 40%, or below 2005 levels, by 2030, and net-zero emissions by 2050.

"Very few people are stepping up to attempt to stop this," says [Donna Kennedy-Glans](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/article-the-current-energy-crisis-shows-politicians-need-to-move-beyond/), regarding large-scale renewable energy projects around the country.
