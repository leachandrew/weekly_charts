U.K. residents can expect to see an 80% increase in their annual household energy bills, said the country’s energy regulator last month.

The price increase is most attributed to the ongoing war in Ukraine, which affects many prices, especially wholesale natural gas.

This winter, it is forecasted that gas, electricity and other fuels will cost Brits an average of 10% of their household income, or double what they were paying in 2021, according to [Carbon Brief’s calculations of official data](https://www.carbonbrief.org/daily-brief/uk-price-cap-seen-to-breach-6000-for-first-time-in-grim-new-forecast/).

Despite these recent EU developments, Canada's energy supply is as secure as ever, says Natural Resources Canada.

The average residential Ontarion customer's energy/heating bill has increased nearly 250% since the beginning of the aforementioned war, Enbridge says.

However, Canada's steady transition to a greener [energy] economy should bring about cheaper energy bills, says [Xianguo Li](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306261908000020), a professor at the University of Waterloo. He also suggests that in the meantime, Canadians should do what they can to reduce their consumption.
