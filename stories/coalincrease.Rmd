Erica wrote last week about Germany's increasing use of coal in the face of its current energy crisis, but recent data suggests this trend is not confined to Germany. Global coal use is set to rise by 1.2% in 2022, reaching 8 billion tonnes for the first time and surpassing the previous record set in 2013, according to the International Energy Agency's (IEA) annual market report on the sector. While coal consumption is expected to remain flat through 2025 due to strong demand in emerging Asian economies, it is anticipated to fall in advanced economies as renewables replace it for electricity generation. The IEA's report also noted that there is no sign of surging investment in export-driven coal projects, reflecting caution among investors and mining companies about the medium and long-term prospects for coal. Despite this, the world's three largest coal producers – China, India and Indonesia – are all expected to hit production records in 2022. Moreover, coal prices have surged due to the aforementioned energy crisis as well as adverse weather conditions in Australia, which is a major supplier. The IEA produced a special report detailing what could be done to reduce coal use and meet international climate goals, which can be found [here](https://www.iea.org/news/achieving-a-swift-reduction-in-global-coal-emissions-is-the-central-challenge-for-reaching-international-climate-targets).
