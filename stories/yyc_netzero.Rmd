## Calgary's Path to Net Zero

ENMAX and the City of Calgary have partnered up to fund the [Community Solar Fund](https://www.enmax.com/news-events/news/enmax-launches-community-solar-fund-to-benefit-calgary-communities#:~:text=Through%20the%20ENMAX%20Community%20Solar,between%2020%20to%2025%20years.) and its [first installation](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/enmax_the-first-of-dozens-of-solar-energy-installations-activity-6930613834860695552-jEHF?utm_source=linkedin_share&utm_medium=member_desktop_web) is now underway. The $5-million fund will support solar energy installations in select community halls throughout the city, benefiting local neighbourhoods. 

[Alberta](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-solar-energy-pandemic-installation-1.6017305) has some of the best solar resources, and the sunny city of Calgary sees 2,390 hours of sunshine each year. This makes it an ideal place for solar energy to shine.

[Research](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41560-019-0541-9.epdf?author_access_token=w4oTbnp8WUX_v9XxPtWZG9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MqG1JqShy5PRmN4ceQGGIHPvQVXZbV_JeQEcKuSxQioZ8QxRD_x0CGROAtu_181ZXOpIpYyvgcirrdBVjSV8knFjoeo7AvlaF6QzIPw92y8Q%3D%3D) shows that energy choices can be socially influenced. If this is the case, perhaps this project will inspire other municipalities to follow suit. 

The Community Solar Fund will help lower Calgary's emissions, and grow Alberta's renewable energy sector, thereby advancing the country in its path to [net zero by 2050](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050).
