PEI sources [approximately 60%](www.cer-rec.gc.ca/en/data-analysis/energy-markets/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles/provincial-territorial-energy-profiles-prince-edward-island.html) of its electricity from New Brunswick, primarily via an underwater cable.

Summerside is a city of 16,000 on Prince Edward Island. For decades, they've relied on this imported electricity.
