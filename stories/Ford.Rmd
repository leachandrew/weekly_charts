Ford Motor Company announced on August 10th that it will be using [renewable energy sources for all vehicles manufactured](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/ford-renewable-energy-sources-vehicles-101310622.html) in its Michigan facilities by 2025. Three plants at Dearborn, Wayne, and Flat Rock build F-150, Mustang, Ranger, and Bronco models. Ford reached a deal with DTE Energy, Michigan's largest renewable energy producer to power the facilities with renewable energy. It is a big step towards Ford's goal to power all of its global facilities with renewable energy by 2035. According to this deal, DTE will add 650 MW of new solar energy capacity in the state by 2025. The companies are claiming this to be the largest solar energy purchase from a utility in the US. This deal is expected to cut Ford's emissions by 600,000 tons.
