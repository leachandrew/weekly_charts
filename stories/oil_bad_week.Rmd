One of the best parts of Friday charting is that, being in the mountain timezone, I can wait until Rory Johnston's [Commodity Context](https://www.commoditycontext.com/p/ocw-46w22) comes out and (usually) still not be too late posting my charts. This week, with oil having its worst week since August, with both WTI and Brench down over $8 on the week was no exception to Rory's quality content. Most importantly, the front-end of the WTI forward curve is back in contango, which lets me use my favorite word in energy markets in conversation this week.
