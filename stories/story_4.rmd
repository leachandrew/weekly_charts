More of a humblebrag/bucket list item than a news story, but I wanted to draw your attention to my appearance on this week's [The Energy Gang](https://art19.com/shows/the-energy-gang), where Ed Crooks, Amy Myers Jaffe and I will be talking about...the SEC Climate Disclosure Rule, the IPCC AR6 Report, and Canada's climate change plan!

The Energy Gang has been my go-to podcast for all things energy and climate for years, and to get to join the show is a real thrill. I hope you enjoy it.
