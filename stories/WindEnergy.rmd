## Wind Tops Coal in US Electricity

On April 14th, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) [revealed](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=52038) that for the first time ever, wind-powered electricity generation had exceeded both coal and nuclear power generation. While wind generation has exceeded nuclear power and coal-generated electricity separately in the past, this marks the first occasion that both have been surpassed simultaneously.

This landmark comes amid Biden's lofty [Clean Energy Plan](https://joebiden.com/clean-energy/), which includes a pledge to build a carbon-free grid by 2035, while investing $2 trillion towards an "equitable clean energy future."

A number of factors played a role in this historic moment:

* *Waning Power Demand*: Generally, during fall and spring months, the demand for power is decreased. Subsequently, many generators reduce their outputs, or use this time to undergo maintenance;
* *Surge in Wind Output*: March is generally one of the windiest months, and the window in which wind generated electricity overtook coal and nuclear had extremely high wind speeds in the Southwest Power Pool (Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, and neighboring states); and
* *Demand Matching*: Since renewable energy has zero fuel costs, it is prioritized in most electricity systems. In times of low demand, this leaves less market space for other sources of electricity.
