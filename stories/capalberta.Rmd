## Alberta's Electricity Cap Conundrum

As the temporary cap on the regulated rate option (RRO) for electricity in Alberta reaches its end on April 1, residents are left questioning the government's intentions, with some calling the cap a "trap." Initially introduced to help struggling Albertans, the cap comes with a catch: customers must pay back the cumulative costs of energy usage beyond the 13.5 cents per kilowatt-hour limit through rates.

The University of Calgary's School of Public Policy found that around $200 million will have to be repaid by those remaining on the RRO. However, this will not apply to Albertans who switch to a fixed rate to avoid repayment, raising concerns about the potential financial burden on remaining RRO customers. As more people leave the RRO, the cost for those who stay behind could double.

Further complicating matters, not all Albertans can switch from the RRO due to credit or security deposit requirements, leaving the most vulnerable residents to face the financial consequences. Experts recommend that the government should consider covering the deferred costs to mitigate the issue and ensure a more equitable outcome for all affected Albertans.
