## Peak Fossil Fuels

Russia's invasion of Ukraine has caused a number of global ripples, with most being negative. However, some of these ripples might not all be bad for humanity's future according to the latest edition of the IEA's [World Energy Outlook (WEO)](https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2022).

Markets for natural gas, coal and electricity have been severely disrupted by the current geopolitical situation, with effects particularly pronounced in Europe. Oil markets, which have been tumultuous over the past few years, have been thrown into even more turmoil recently. As such, more and more investments are being made in renewable energy. 

While not directly linked to the war in Ukraine, the WEO indicates that for the first time ever, global demand for fossil fuels will reach either a peak or plateau by mid 2030's. This is astonishing news as fossil fuel usage has increased alongside GDP since the beginning of the industrial revolution. This paradigm shift may very well mark a turning point for humanity.

The IEA report also explains how the increase in solar PV, wind energy, electric vehicles, and battery storage has contributed to the declining use of fossil fuels, and how the development of policy that supports these endeavors could result in an even quicker decline in humanity's use of fossil fuels. 

Russia has historically been one of the world's largest exporters of fossil fuels, but sanctions resulting from the invasion of Ukraine are pushing countries that once relied on these exports to shift to cleaner, greener energy. We've covered some of the bigger projects, especially the ones occurring in Germany in previous editions of the Weekly Charts, but it seems as though a growing number of countries are beginning to see energy independence as a benefit, and investing in renewable technologies to achieve that.
