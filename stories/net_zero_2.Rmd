## Business of Net-Zero
#### Erica Beattie

Governments and businesses are preparing for a transition to net-zero emissions. While this will have many benefits and create wonderful economic opportunities, it  will also come with its own set of consequences. [A report from McKinsey this week](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/the-net-zero-transition-what-it-would-cost-what-it-could-bring) explains some of the uncertainties around the initiative and the economic transformation that net-zero transitions can bring.

The report highlights [six characteristics](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/six-characteristics-define-the-net-zero-transition) including a requirement for a large, front-loaded increase in spending.

Accelerating decarbonization is needed to achieve net-zero, but would require emissions to fall across the entire economy and serious changes to be made towards the energy mix. Achieving this is not an easy, straightforward task. McKinsey suggests that making use of a [circular economy](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/mapping-the-benefits-of-a-circular-economy) is one way to achieve this.

The net-zero transition will not affect everyone in the same way or to the same degree. While all sectors are impacted by the transition, they are impacted unevenly. Lower income and developing countries would also be affected differently compared to developed countries in terms of job rates and government spending. And, of course, jurisdictions more dependent on carbon-intensive production are more vulnerable too.

Serious adjustments are needed in order to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and McKinsey argues that coordination between the actions of governments, businesses, and enabling institutions is critical for success. Some of these actions are highlighted in further detail [here](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/sustainability/our-insights/managing-the-net-zero-transition-actions-for-stakeholders).
