On August 9th, Mayor of Chicago, Lori E. Lightfoot announced that, in collaboration with electricity supplier Constellation and Swift Current Energy, the city would purchased renewable energy for all city facilities by 2025. This push has been one of the first of its kind in North America for a city the size of Chicago, and will hopefully inspire others to do the same. 

Mayor Lightfoot stated that, “the signing of this agreement demonstrates that the City of Chicago is leading by example and driving high-impact climate action, building the clean energy workforce of the future and equitably distributing meaningful benefits to foster the local clean energy economy for all.”

The project will also serve to [provide renewable energy to other major organizations in the state](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/mayor/press_room/press_releases/2022/august/Purchase100PercentCleanRenewableEnergy2025.html).

The project, dubbed Double Black Diamond Solar, with a capacity of 593 megawatts will be one of the largest solar projects in Illinois. Construction will begin at the end of 2022.
