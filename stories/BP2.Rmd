## BP's Oil Sands Exit
#### Erica Beattie

Earlier this week, British energy giant BP announced their exit from the Alberta oilsands. The company is selling its 50% stake in the Sunrise oilsands project to Cenovus Energy Inc. Cenovus will transfer its 35% stake in the Bay du Nord project to BP. 

BP has decided to exit Alberta oilsands in order to shift their focus onto offshore oil development. This is one more name added to the list of major international companies to exit the oil sands in recent years. 

Full ownership of the Sunrise project will increase Cenovus' strength in the oilsands. The company expects Sunrise's production levels to increase from its current 50,000 barrels per day to 60,000 per day.
