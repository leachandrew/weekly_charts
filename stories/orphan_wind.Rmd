## Orphaned Renewable Equipment, is it possible?
#### [Marc Vermette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-vermette/)

Many of Alberta’s rural municipalities were left in the dust when the oil price crashed last decade, resulting in [billions of dollars of equipment being left behind](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/orphaned-wells-liability-alberta-1.6326942) by bankrupt fuel companies.

Because of this, many rural Albertans are not optimistic when they see massive developments of wind and solar energy: they fear a repeat of the province’s orphan well crisis.

Renewable energy companies are required to provide an overview of how they plan to cover decommissioning and reclamation costs before they can proceed with their project. 

And, unlike oil and gas leases, there is no split title in the case of renewables. The government will not force access. For landowners, entering into a wind or solar lease is entirely voluntary.

This differs from a resource lease where property (or *surface rights*) owners [are not allowed to refuse access](https://www.cbc.ca/news/business/trident-exploration-alberta-oilpatch-rma-surface-leases-1.5121507) to companies that plan to develop fossil fuels under the surface of their land. And, once a well has been drilling, landowners have limited standing to ensure its timely reclamation. In the case of a renewable energy development, landowners would not be required to cede their property rights, although they may choose to do so.

Might the recent burst in renewable energy development cause a repeat of past events? If so, it certainly won't be for the same reasons.
