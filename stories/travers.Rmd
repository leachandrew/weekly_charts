Alberta's renewable energy supply will see huge boost when the [Travers Solar Project](https://www.traverssolar.com/) comes online in Fall 2022. The project will nearly double Alberta's solar capacity. The project - the largest of its kind in Canada - has been in development since 2017. It spans 3300 acres using 1.3 million solar panels and will provide enough power for 150,000 homes once operational.

Alberta is a prime candidate for more solar energy investment, with a [competitive wholesale power market](https://www.alberta.ca/alberta-electricity-overview.aspx) and the [second highest potential for solar energy](https://solaralberta.ca/learn/why-go-solar/) generation in Canada. The Travers Solar Project drew [$700 million](https://www.power-technology.com/news/travers-solar-project/) from Danish energy investment firm Copenhagen Infrastructure Partners, and is among [many new privately-financed renewable energy developments in Canada](https://businessrenewables.ca/deal-tracker).
