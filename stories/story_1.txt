Exxon Mobil Corp is aiming for a production cost of $15US per barrel in the Permian. A cost this low has only been seen in the massive oil fields in the Middle East. Exxon is able to set its sights on a cost level this low due to the scale of its production and an ability to spread costs throughout many operations. The Permian field alone produces close to 4 million barrels per day (bpd),  almost as much as the entirety of Iraq. This number will likely double by 2025 according to the president of the company's shale division. There are plans for Exxon to deploy 55 rigs in the Permian in 2019 as a part of the company's plan to increase its production in the region by a factor of five, to 1 million bpd by 2024. As a part of this plan Exxon is looking to build its own take-away infrastructure.
