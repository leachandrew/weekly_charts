An [article from Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-01-03/tesla-faces-higher-lithium-prices-after-supplier-amends-deal) states that Tesla's supplier of the lithium that powers their vehicles, Piedmont Lithium Inc., amended their agreement with the EV giant. Now, Piedmont will supply 125,000 metric tons of lithium concentrate to Tesla starting in the second half of 2023 through to the end of 2025. Prior agreements had prices locked in, but this current deal includes variable pricing based on market prices. This is a significant change for Tesla. 

Given Tesla's market power as the biggest buyer in its sector, they have been able to dictate agreement terms, resulting in long-term supply deals at fixed prices. This is changing as prices of key battery materials, such as lithium, are rising relentlessly, to over 1,200% above recent years' prices, as supply struggles to meet increasing demand. Because of this, manufacturers have had to raise their prices. Just this past year, the average price for a lithium-ion battery pack increased by 7%. Two years ago, the initial agreement between Tesla and Piedmont was announced, and lithium prices were at an all-time low because of the pandemic. Some are predicting that this new supply agreement with Tesla will "deliver highly attractive margins" for Piedmont.
