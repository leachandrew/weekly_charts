The Canadian Association of Energy Contractors (CAOEC) held its State of the Industry Conference this week in Calgary and touted an optimistic outlook for the coming year. 

CAOEC CEO Mark Scholz discussed several areas of growth predicted in the [CAOEC's forecast for 2023](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/drilling-forecast-canada-oil-gas-1.6661628). The forecast projects 6,409 new wells in 2023 for an approximately 15% increase year-over-year. CAOEC also expects a year-over-year increase of 5,400 jobs for a total of 42,350 people employed directly and indirectly by the drilling sector in 2023. The growth is expected to come as the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion and Coastal GasLink project are completed, increasing capacity. Drillers are also expecting to get a boost from emerging energy transition fields like helium, in-situ hydrogen, mineral extraction, and carbon capture utilization and storage.

Alberta Premier Danielle Smith gave the [keynote speech](https://boereport.com/2022/11/25/danielle-smith-speaks-at-2022-state-of-the-industry-event/). Like Scholz, she talked optimistically about the outlook for next year and expressed the government's support of the industry. Smith touted the oil industry's importance for the Alberta and Canadian economies, and argued that oil and gas demand will remain for decades, and, therefore, production must as well, albeit in a greener form through emissions reductions technology. The Premier also discussed the emergence and possibilities of growing clean hydrogen production and increased activity along the natural gas value chain.
