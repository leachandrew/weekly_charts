## CCUS and the Oil Sands

#### Erica Beattie

There is a lot of talk these days about how Canada is in a strong position to ensure global energy security, but this is not without its challenges. The main issue being how to accomplish this without sacrificing our climate goals. A new report from [RBC](https://thoughtleadership.rbc.com/the-new-climate-bargain-how-canada-can-manage-energy-environmental-security/) shows just how hard reconciling these two objectives might be.

RBC's study shows that full decarbonization of the oil sands could cost between $6 and $14 per barrel for mined bitumen and $17 and $23 for in situ bitumen.

If that doesn't stop you in your tracks this week, I don't know what will.
