## Forever Energy - A New Way to Store Energy?

The device you're using to read this story likely uses a lithium battery. Lithium batteries have been the preferred option for short-term energy storage, but Forever Energy hopes to change this. As solar adoption has increased in the United States and Canada, energy storage has become more valuable. While some argue that lithium should be used for stationary battery technology, CEO of Forever Energy Craig Jones argues that vanadium flow batteries are a much more elegant solution. His company aims to make affordable vanadium flow batteries available for consumers to store their excess solar energy, as well as create options for commercial solar enterprises. Vanadium flow batteries are already seeing use in China, which is significantly further ahead than the rest of the world in the research, development and deployment of this battery type. Vanadium flow batteries offer many advantages over traditional lithium batteries â€” they are [non-flammable and non-explosive, do not lose capacity over time, create less waste, last longer, and operate under a wider range of conditions](https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/storage/lithium-or-vanadium-in-energy-storage-its-no-contest/)

Forever Energy is currently raising equity, and will see a final decision made by the Department of Energy for a $1.6 billion loan. Moreover, they are finalizing negotiations with the state of Louisiana to build the vanadium processing factory they require to create these batteries. Jones wants the US to have its own supply chain in vanadium processing, emphasizing that vanadium is a fairly common element, much more than lithium, and that nearly 99% of currently isolated vanadium is used in steel hardening. Steel production is mainly done in China, and Jones sees the need to divert vanadium supplies back to American soil. The US administration has also put manufacturing credits into place via the [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-bill/5376/text) that Forever Energy can take advantage of. Overall, vanadium flow batteries are a definite contender in the stationary energy storage market, and with Forever Energy on the path of production, we are likely to see vanadium flow batteries sometime soon.
