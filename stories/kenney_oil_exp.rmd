Alberta Premier Jason Kenney told a US Senate committee that technical improvements to existing pipelines and increased crude-by-rail shipments could boost Canada's oil export capacity to the US by up to 900,000 barrels per day (BPD).

As Europe wants to minimize its dependency on Russian oil, Alberta, Canada's largest oil-producing province, has explored ways to boost pipeline utilization to increase crude exports.

Canada's government has already announced that it plans to increase oil exports by 300,000 BPD through pipelines by the end of this year.

Additional information:

* 900,000 BPD would represent a 25% increase from recent export levels

* 300,000 BPD would represent approximately an 8% increase from recent export levels.

* Light crude oil makes up ~29% of all crude oil exports, while the balance (~71%) is heavy crude oil.
