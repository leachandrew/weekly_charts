## Alberta's Cheap Wind Power

#### [Andrew Leach](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/leach-econ)

A little personal bragging this week as my [new paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301421522004852?via%3Dihub) with Sara Hastings-Simon, Blake Shaffer, and Tim Weis is out at Energy Policy. In this paper, we look the Renewable Energy Program (REP) introduced under the Notley government, and show how the procurement continues to generate large energy revenues for the government.

We'll have an open-access version of the paper up shortly, and watch for a new publication through Calgary's School of Public Policy that updates the results to current values.
