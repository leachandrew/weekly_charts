## UK Tidal Power

Unlike [traditional tidal energy generation](https://www.eia.gov/energyexplained/hydropower/tidal-power.php) through barrages, where turbines are mounted in walls, tidal stream turbines are directly lowered into strong tides within specific sea locations.

The cost of tidal stream power generation has fallen 40% since 2018.

Because of this, we see increasing potential in this energy source that generates power from something very predictable and omnipresent: the changing of the tides.

[Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult](https://ore.catapult.org.uk/about/), a government research centre, forecasts that prices of tidal stream energy [may drop below those of nuclear power](https://ore.catapult.org.uk/?orecatapultreports=cost-reduction-pathway-of-tidal-stream-energy-in-the-uk-and-france) by 2035.

Simon Cheeseman, a researcher, stresses the importance of facilitating the research and development of tidal energy.

He compares its potential development to the successful history of offshore wind power generation, which has gone from [generating energy for 4% to 33%](https://www.thecrownestate.co.uk/en-gb/media-and-insights/news/the-crown-estate-s-2021-offshore-wind-report-reveals-uk-industry-united-in-race-to-net-zero/) of UK homes in only 11 years.
