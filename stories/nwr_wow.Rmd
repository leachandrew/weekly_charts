## Record Sturgeon (Margins)!

No, not the fish. Thanks to reader Lance Freeman, I took a look at margins for the Sturgeon refinery for the first time in a while. 

Well, they're high. Really high. Record high.

I've spent lots of time criticizing this investment, and there is still no reason to have nearly doubled the tolls on this refinery, but for the past while, it should have been pushing some big returns onto the Government's (and the proponent's) books.
