## The True Cost of In-person Work

#### <font size="+2">[Marc Vermette](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/marc-vermette)

With the start of the recent transition from remote (working from home) employment, many companies are making the [shift back to in-person work](https://globalnews.ca/news/8802626/return-to-work-canada-analysis-covid-19/).

This transition is taking place simultaneously with [record-high inflation levels](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/220316/dq220316a-eng.htm), with many costs skyrocketing in price. One of these affected costs is transportation, and at the current point in time, a very relevant one is the price of gas.

It could be interesting to determine the effective pay cut that the average Canadian receives when transitioning back from working from home to working at an office or firm in person.

Based on the following information based on Canadian workers:

* Average [hourly part and full-time hourly wage](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410006401) of $30.03

* Average [commute distance](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/190225/dq190225a-eng.htm) of 8.7 kilometres (costing $0.0327/km [[maintenance](https://ama.ab.ca/auto/buying-selling/driving-cost-calculator)] + $1.951/litre [[gas](https://www.caa.ca/gas-prices/), using about [10 litres/100km](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuel_economy_in_automobiles)])

* Average [commute time](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/190225/dq190225a-eng.htm) of 24 minutes (opportunity cost based on average hourly wage)

* Average [time worked per week](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1410004301) of 37.5 hours (divided by five days worked, 7.5 hours per day)

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, results = 'hide'}

df <- data.frame(
  group = c("% Average hourly pay maintained", "% Average hourly pay cut (from driving costs)"),
  x = c(93.79, 6.21)
  )
head(df)

library(ggplot2)
bp<- ggplot(df, aes(y="", x=x, fill=group))+
geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity")

pie <- bp + coord_polar("x", start=0) + scale_fill_brewer(palette="Blues") + theme_minimal() + ggtitle("Average Canadian Effective Hourly Wage (Working in-person) Visualized")
pie

```

We can determine that the average hourly pay decrease is about 6.21% per day worked (and commuted) upon returning to in-person work.

Next week, however, we are going to be covering the opposite end of this topic, and we will be looking at things such as:

* [Automobile allowance rates](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/payroll/benefits-allowances/automobile/automobile-motor-vehicle-allowances/automobile-allowance-rates.html) that help to ‘mitigate’ this pay decrease
* People who commute to work, but not through driving
* Increased electricity bills and other costs associated with working from home
