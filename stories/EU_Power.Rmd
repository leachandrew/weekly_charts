With Russia cutting off gas flows, many analysts are saying that a Europe-wide recession is inevitable. [Record-high energy bills are coming for the winter](https://www.cbc.ca/news/world/europe-winter-energy-crisis-1.6596446), and even with substantial government support, Europe will be gripped with an affordability crisis.

[Bloomberg Economics](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/europe-faces-an-energy-crisis-how-bad-could-things-get#xj4y7vzkg) now has a 1% drop in GDP in their base case forecast for next year, and things could get worse than that with a cold winter. In that case, Bloomberg pegs the drop at as much as 5%. A drop this large would mirror the 2009 'great' recession, an event almost nobody wants to repeat. 

Oddly-enough, despite the coming energy crisis, [solar panels are currently piling up in warehouses in Europe](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-09-27/solar-panels-piling-up-in-warehouses-in-energy-starved-europe). Why? The installers are simply not available to complete installations fast enough.
