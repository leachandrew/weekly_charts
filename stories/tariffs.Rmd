## Tariffs vs. Climate Action
#### [Marc Vermette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-vermette/)

[A new study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05316-6) looks at how policies and tariffs created to protect manufacturers of renewable technologies, especially solar energy, threaten efforts to combat climate change globally.

Prices for solar modules could be as much as 25% higher than they would otherwise be by 2030 because of tariffs and other protectionist or nationalist policies.

[John Helveston](https://www.jhelvy.com/), the author of the study, stressed the role of cost minimization in making renewable energy technology “more attractive” to prospective consumers." He also pointed out that low-carbon technologies could be an area for the US and China to collaborate, given that they are not as politically sensitive as other industries. China is responsible for the manufacturing of 79% of the world’s panels, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data. The study warned against relying on a single or a few countries only for supply chains. “We need to have local manufacturers for resilience purposes,” Helveston said, “but [not] at the expense of also trading with China. We should be doing both.”

Trade disputes are not new to the renewable power sector. The solar industry has been [involved in trade conflicts](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/planetpolicy/2018/02/09/what-past-experience-tells-us-about-the-impact-of-new-american-solar-tariffs/) for over a decade.
