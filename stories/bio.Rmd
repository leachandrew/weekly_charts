Based on provincial regulation changes, Nova Scotia Power now plans to utilize [biomass](https://education.nationalgeographic.org/resource/biomass-energy) as a means of power generation for the next few years.

However, adoption of this [‘renewable energy’](https://www.nrdc.org/experts/nathanael-greene/biomass-not-carbon-neutral-and-often-not-clean) has sparked debate between the forestry industry and environmentalists.

Ecology Action Centre's Ray Plourde called the decision “a sick joke” and argued that it was not a real solution to any ongoing crises.

"It's a disaster for the atmosphere and [...] biodiversity."

He referenced a [recent Australian policy](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/dec/16/electricity-generated-by-burning-native-australian-timber-no-longer-classified-as-renewable-energy?CMP=share_btn_tw) where electricity generated by burning timber is no longer classified as *renewable* energy.

On the other hand, Natural Resources Minister Tory Rushton points towards timber biomass as a temporary tool to help Canada through the energy crisis. 
Rushton also mentioned how sawmills in the province have lots of wood byproducts that could finally be utilized, while highlighting that the regulations prohibit the cutting of whole trees to generate electricity via biomass.

Plourde claims that better uses for these byproducts would be making [pressboard](https://impactful.ninja/how-sustainable-is-particle-board-ldf/), [biochar](https://www.agmrc.org/renewable-energy/renewable-energy-climate-change-report/renewable-energy-climate-change-report/december-2009-newsletter/biochar---a-multitude-of-benefits#:~:text=Major%20benefits%20of%20biochar&text=Pyrolysis%20is%20a%20form%20of,used%20as%20a%20renewable%20fuel), or for [district heating](https://www.treco.co.uk/news/article/the-benefits-of-biomass-boiler-district-heating).
