For years, Europe has been relying on Russia for around 40% of its natural gas, most of which is delivered through pipelines through Belarus, Poland, Germany, and Ukraine.

While not every country gets gas directly from Russia, if countries like Germany (Europe’s top buyer of Russian gas) receive less, they must fill the gap elsewhere, and this has a knock-on effect on the gas which is available for other countries. For example, though Britain generally gets less than 4% of its gas from Russia, changes in Russian supplies cause price volatility there as the rest of Europe scrambles for alternative sources.

According to EnergyNow, this year Moscow has already cut gas flows to Bulgaria, Poland, Finland, Danish supplier Orsted, Dutch firm Gasterra, and Shell for its German contracts, after they all rejected a Kremlin demand to switch to payments in rubles – a move in response to European sanctions.

“Gas flows from Russia through the three main pipelines have plummeted 26% in June compared with May to an average of around 1,771 gigawatt hours a day (GWh/d)”, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon.
The European Union has started to look for alternatives to Russian fossil fuels in an aim to end reliance, and one such alternative is to increase the imports of liquefied natural gas (LNG).
Refinitiv data show that LNG imports rose about 58% in the first five months of 2022 compared with 2021 levels, with high prices in Europe attracting more cargoes. However, Europe has limited capacity to receive LNG and supply concerns deepened further after an explosion last week.
