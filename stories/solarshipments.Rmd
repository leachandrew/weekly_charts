The annual photovoltaic module shipments report this week revealed that 2021 saw a record breaking number of solar panel shipments in the United States. Shipments include exports of, imports of and domestically produced and shipped solar panels. In 2021, 80% of the shipments were imports, of those imports, most were from Asia. These shipments will allow US solar capacity to rise from a peak of 21.8 million kW to a peak of 28.8 million kW. This increase of 7 million kW is mainly driven by the continued demand for solar energy in the United States, as well as the world. In 2021, the top 5 states for solar panel shipments were California, Texas, Florida, Georgia and Illinois respectively. These 5 states combined account for a staggering 46% of all US solar shipments.
