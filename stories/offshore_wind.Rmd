## Offshore Wind Project Queue Doubles

EnergyPulse claims that the global pipeline for offshore wind projects — projects that are operational, under construction, consented to or planned — has doubled in the past year, from 429 GW of capacity to 846 GW. Offshore wind projects have become increasingly popular. Generating [substantially](https://marinerenewables.ca/facts/offshore-wind-energy/) more energy as a result of the higher wind speeds, offshore wind projects are a sky part of the future of renewable electricity. China, the UK and the USA are leading in offshore wind development, but Canada has a promising landscape for such projects, with [great wind resources available](https://policyoptions.irpp.org/magazines/february-2022/canada-offshore-wind-power/#:~:text=The%20continent%20now%20has%20116,wind%20power%20capacity%20by%202030.). Canada has plans for [31 offshore farm projects in the works.](https://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/canada/)

This data also reveal some interesting insights about other countries. While most currently-installed capacity is in western countries, sizeable levels are present in Asian and South American countries too. This is promising, as it indicates that efforts are being made globally. There are also implications for the utility of this specific form of renewable energy. While not feasible for landlocked countries, it does allow countries with limiting geographical features (i.e. lack of space, uneven terrain, etc.) to embrace renewable energy.

With zero emission goals present in much of the western, and similar goals becoming more prevalent in the rest of the world, offshore wind is an important resource to watch in the coming years.
