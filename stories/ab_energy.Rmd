## ST-98 is out!

#### Erica Beattie

The Alberta Energy Regular released their [annual energy outlook for 2022](https://static.aer.ca/prd/documents/sts/ST98/2022/ST982022_ExecutiveSummary.pdf) last week, and there shall be much rejoicing (at least among those who like energy charts and data).

[The Edmonton Journal reports](https://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/varcoe-higher-prices-rising-output-alberta-energy-resource-production-to-top-163b-this-year/wcm/03f9ca22-2ee8-4e1d-a3be-e1d941857b2c?utm_medium=Social&utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1654607139) that energy output in Alberta is on the rise.

The AER forecasts that Alberta will see an increase in the production of most energy sources through 2031. Domestic hydrogen production in particular is expected to increase by over a million tonnes in the next decade with [several projects](https://www.alberta.ca/hydrogen-roadmap.aspx) announced this past year in Alberta.

Due to increases in global energy demand and strong prices, AER also forecasts higher capital expenditures by the oil and gas industry.
