An executive VP at [Enbridge](https://www.enbridge.com/About-Us/Renewable-energy.aspx), Colin Gruending, praised the incentives built into the 369-billion USD [Inflation Reduction Act](https://www.forbes.com/sites/energyinnovation/2022/08/23/inflation-reduction-act-benefits-clean-energy-tax-credits-could-double-deployment/?sh=3597ece26727) (IRA), which could be considered a significant precursor to the North American transition towards renewables and clean energy infrastructure.

Enbridge's pipeline business overshadows its renewable portfolio, but the company's scale means its 'green' efforts compete with some of the largest projects in Canada.

Canada's carbon pricing regime and tax credits for [CCUS](https://www.iea.org/fuels-and-technologies/carbon-capture-utilisation-and-storage) already boost the return on such projects, but there are calls for a response to the IRA.

Canadian energy companies are looking for more investment tax credits covering a broader set of net-zero technologies, including battery storage solutions and clean hydrogen energy.
