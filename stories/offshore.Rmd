## World's Largest Renewable Power Plant

Over the past decade, China has shown a strong commitment to renewable energy, with [1063 GW](https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/energy-transition/092322-china-could-exceed-renewables-generation-target-of-33-by-2025#:~:text=According%20to%20the%20NEA%20report,to%20the%20intermittency%20of%20renewables) of installed renewable generation capacity (nearly 45% of the nation's total generation capacity). It comes as little surprise that the world's largest renewable plant, an offshore wind farm, will be constructed in southern China.

The 43 GW wind farm will be built in the Taiwan Strait, off the coast of the city of Chaozhou, located in the province of Guangdong. This was an ideal location for the wind farm -- unique topographical features create high wind speeds, which allow for the turbines to run 43-49% of the time. This is an unusually high capacity factor, and is a definite boon for the project. China currently has the largest fleet of offshore wind farms in the world, and with this addition, it's unlikely that title will be taken from them any time soon.
