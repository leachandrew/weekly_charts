## Remote Community Diesel

#### [Marc Vermette](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marc-vermette/)

Many communities in Nunavut and other remote regions in Canada remain completely dependent on diesel for electricity and heating.

This results in energy systems that are expensive, unreliable, and a major source of pollution. For example, the pollution rate from electricity generation within Nunavut is [8 times higher](https://www.qec.nu.ca/power-nunavut/renewable-energy) than the national average.

The Canadian government plans on [eliminating diesel-powered generation](https://www.pembina.org/blog/tracking-diesel-reduction-progress-remote-communities) in these remote communities by 2030.

However, many experts claim this goal is out of reach given the current progress towards the infrastructure needed to accomplish it.

There are 200+ remote communities in Canada that arenâ€™t connected to the electricity grid.

Power producers and residents have reservations about a switch to renewable energy. This has to change, says [Ian Gates](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/357418934_Why_is_it_so_difficult_to_replace_diesel_in_Nunavut_Canada), an expert in the field.
