Despite this goal, [investment into the country’s coal power generation](https://chinadialogue.net/en/climate/vietnam-targets-net-zero-but-struggles-to-break-coal-dependence/) is expected to [continue to rise](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48176) steadily until 2035.

Now, G-7 countries have approved a deal to provide Vietnam with $15.5 billion to aid their shift towards renewable energy.

This funding comes from both public and private sources over the coming 3-5 years, with the majority coming as loans.

“The investment we are making today means [this emerging economy] can cut its emissions while [...] creating new jobs and growth,” says the British Prime Minister.
