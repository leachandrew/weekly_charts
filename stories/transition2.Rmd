## Is the energy transition easier for the rich?

Spending on clean energy is expected to reach a record $1.4 trillion in 2022, [according to the IEA](https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics/charts/annual-clean-energy-investment-2017-2022).

However, this economic and environmental growth takes place primarily in richer countries with lower costs of financing new infrastructure.

Middle-income countries can spend upwards of twice as much paying off debt, as well as having a significantly harder time acquiring loans for projects like these.

The UN, consisting primarily of richer countries, previously promised to grant developing countries $100 billion annually in financing to cut their emissions and adapt to a hotter world. This promise [was broken](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-02846-3).

The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/11/03/countries-could-cut-emissions-by-70-by-2050-and-boost-resilience-with-annual-investments-of-1-4-of-gdp) determined that “contributing 1.4% of GDP annually could help to reduce emissions in developing countries by as much as 70% by 2050,” while also increasing their energy security.
