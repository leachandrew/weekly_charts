Canada’s largest oil sands producers have agreed to work together to reach a net-zero emissions target by 2050, in line with Canada’s 2035 goal.

The challenge is significant, however, as oil sands are among the most emissions-intensive sources of oil in the world.

In the first phase of their Net Zero pathway, the oil sands producers expect to eliminate 22 megatonnes of annual emissions by 2030, with 10 megatonnes coming from CCUS projects.

“Research is going to be required for us if we’re going to win the energy transition — and we’re going to win it,” (James Dunn, Imperial Oil’s director of sustainable technology integration)

A majority of the technology needed to lower oil sands emissions is understood, but the key will be making the finances work.

“[Ultimately, there] will be a preference for stable, secure hydrocarbons from countries like Canada…” (Jackie Forrest, executive director of ARC Energy Research Institute)
