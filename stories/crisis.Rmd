The world is on track to add a similar amount of renewable energy capacity in the next 5 years that it did in the previous 20.

This increase is 30% higher than the growth that was forecasted last year, showcasing the power of governments taking action throughout the energy crisis.

In the next 5 years, renewable energy capacity is expected to double, potentially sustaining the 1.5°C goal that was [previously thought dead](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-08/is-the-1-5c-warming-goal-dead-cop27-and-climate-overshoot).

“This is a clear example of how the current energy crisis can be a historic turning point towards a cleaner and more secure energy [future],” said IEA executive director Fatih Birol.
