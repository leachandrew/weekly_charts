The US [Energy Information Administration (EIA)](https://www.eia.gov/) releases a monthly [short-term energy outlook](https://www.eia.gov/outlooks/steo/) with outlooks for most energy commodities. I maintain an updated graph pack for these outlooks at my [STEO data page](https://leachandrew.github.io/EIA-STEO/). I hope you enjoy it.
