[Hydro-Québec](https://www.statista.com/topics/2569/hydro-quebec), Canada's leading supplier of clean energy to the United States, has [new plans](https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/electricity-exports-to-new-york-from-quebec-will-happen-as-early-as-2025-hydro-quebec-1.5681151) to supply 1,250 megawatts of hydroelectric electricity to New York City.

The [Champlain Hudson Power Express](https://chpexpress.com) underground route, created to facilitate this supply, is scheduled to open in 2025.

Over a 25-year period, the export value of Canadian energy is estimated to exceed $20 billion.

Canada is already more than [80% clean](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/environment/weather/climatechange/climate-action/powering-future-clean-energy.html) (as opposed to the [US's 40%](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=427)), owing primarily to:

  * hydroelectric energy
  * nuclear power

Last year, Canada exported [60.3 terawatt hours of power](https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/canada-energy), a 50 percent increase over 2010 and four times the amount exported in 1990.


The exports, which account for around a tenth of the electricity generated in Canada, amount to barely a few of percentage points of US consumption.

Every bit helps to "green" US electricity, and bolster Canada's economic bottom line.

There are big environmental benefits, too, as the New York City deal will cut four megatonnes a year of emissions – the same as closing an [oil sands mine](www.alberta.ca/climate-oilsands-emissions.aspx).
