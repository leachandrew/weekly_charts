The Indian government has [pledged to invest $4.3 billion USD in green technology](https://climatechangenews.com/2023/02/01/india-plans-4-3-billion-investment-in-clean-energy/) to reduce carbon intensity of the economy and create jobs in its latest annual budget. The investment will focus on solar power from the Himalayan region of Ladakh and green hydrogen production. The petroleum and natural gas ministry will oversee the investments, which will include subsidies for private-sector battery energy storage projects, pumped storage, and investments in electricity transmission lines.

Additionally, India's government has launched a national green hydrogen mission which aims to produce 5 million metric tons by 2030. The budget also includes money to adapt to the effects of climate change and to build irrigation systems and mangrove trees. However, the government's transportation policies have received criticism for promoting both clean and polluting forms of transport. This investment comes amid many energy concerns and goals for India — between global warming, rising sea levels, a need for energy independence and a [governmental push for locally made electric vehicles](https://www.digitimes.com/news/a20230202VL200/battery-handset-india.html) — the need for a reliable, clean source of energy is becoming increasingly apparent.
