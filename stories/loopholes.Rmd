## Lobbying for Methane Regulation Loopholes

Canadian investigative journalist, [Carl Meyer](https://twitter.com/ottawacarl) documented the impact of lobbying on a major energy policy decision in Alberta in a long article at The Narwhal we briefly mentioned last week.

Meyer [finds](https://twitter.com/ottawacarl/status/1539603534953562113?cxt=HHwWgoC-vcDQ4t0qAAAA) that rather than imposing [strict limits on the pollution created](https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/news/2022/03/government-of-canada-launches-next-steps-towards-deeper-methane-reductions-from-oil-and-gas.html) by the industry’s older, less efficient, and higher-emitting facilities, companies lobbied successfully to be allowed to meet emission targets based on the average emission levels of a select group of their facilities.

This change allows companies to more easily meet methane emissions targets for heavy oil prooduction.

The regulations were finalized in this way despite officials saying that it would likely encourage companies and individuals to “game” the system, making compliance harder to enforce.

According to Meyer, the loophole was proposed by Canadian Natural Resources, a company that operates a majority (54%) of oil production within Canada and has consistently had among the highest [methane gas venting rates](https://www.edf.org/climate/methane-crucial-opportunity-climate-fight) in the industry.
