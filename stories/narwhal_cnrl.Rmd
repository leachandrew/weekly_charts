A story this week at [The Narwhal](https://thenarwhal.ca/) from Carl Meyer really raised my eyebrows and highlights how important details can be in policy design.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, and reducing methane has long been touted by Alberta's oil and gas industry as a low cost (even negative cost) way to reduce emissions. Meyer's story is very detailed, so I'll leave it to you to [read here](https://thenarwhal.ca/alberta-climate-methane-cnrl/).
