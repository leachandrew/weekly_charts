## Is nuclear key to net zero?

Is nuclear energy a net zero shortcut? The answer may be less certain than you think.

The IEA foresees a key role for nuclear power production, arguing that it will need to double by 2050 on an optimal trajectory to meet emissions targets.

According to the IEA, this increase in nuclear power would help to improve energy security by reducing governments dependence on imported fossil fuels.

However, at this time, [almost 65%](https://www.energy.gov/ne/articles/whats-lifespan-nuclear-reactor-much-longer-you-might-think) of nuclear plants in the world are over 30 years old, with many nearing the end of their initially designated operation licences.

On top of this, out of all the reactors that have begun construction since 2017, [nearly 90%](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/07/01/russian-and-chinese-designs-in-87percent-of-new-nuclear-reactors-iea-chief.html) are either of Russian or Chinese design.

New nuclear plants have also been met with [delays](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/edf-hopeful-end-sight-long-delayed-budget-busting-nuclear-plant-2022-06-16/), [cost over-runs](https://news.mit.edu/2020/reasons-nuclear-overruns-1118), and [negative public opinion](https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/19/energy/nuclear-energy-climate-cmd-intl/index.html).

“A new era for nuclear power is by no means guaranteed [and governments need to] ensure safe and sustainable operation of nuclear plants for years to come [...] The nuclear industry must quickly address the issues of cost overruns and project delays.” - [Fatih Birol](https://www.iea.org/contributors/dr-fatih-birol), IEA Executive Director
